Hello, I am a Junior at Texas A&M University-San Antonio studying Computer Science.
Skilled in Java with experience in building applications (GUI) using IntelliJ
However, Iâ€™m looking to improve my coding skills specifically (Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
This will be the best way to see my projects
